1. Evaluate emotional weight alignment. Read the game description to determine the emotional intensity of the experience — whether it is heavy and grave or light and buoyant — then assess whether the candidate title carries that same sense of weight. A title for a psychologically dense game should land with heft; a title for a carefree game should feel unburdened. Rank titles higher when their emotional gravity matches the game's, and lower when the title feels heavier or lighter than the experience it names.

2. Evaluate mood congruence. Identify the specific emotional atmosphere conveyed by the game description — whether it is eerie, jubilant, melancholic, tense, serene, mischievous, desperate, or something else entirely — then assess whether the candidate title projects that same mood. The title should make the reader feel, even for a moment, the way the game intends to make the player feel for hours. Rank titles higher when their atmospheric color matches the game's emotional climate, and lower when the title evokes a mood that clashes with or drifts from the one the game inhabits.

3. Evaluate expressive precision. Beyond matching the broad emotional territory, assess whether the candidate title captures the specific shade of feeling that defines this particular game. Two games may both be dark, but one may be gothic and brooding while the other is nihilistic and cold — and their titles should not be interchangeable. Rank titles higher when they feel precisely calibrated to the game's unique emotional identity, as though no other words could so exactly name its texture, and lower when they merely gesture at the right neighborhood without finding the exact address.
