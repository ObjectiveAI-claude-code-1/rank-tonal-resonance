Rank candidate video game titles by how well each one matches the emotional register, mood, and tone of the game as conveyed by its description. Where thematic relevance concerns what a game is about, tonal resonance concerns how the game feels. Two games might share a theme — say, survival — but feel entirely different: one bleak and harrowing, the other lighthearted and comedic. The title must match not just the subject but the emotional texture. A title should prepare the player for the feel of the experience — it should sound the way the game feels. Titles that create tonal dissonance, such as a whimsical name for a grim game or a somber name for a playful one, should be ranked lower than titles whose tone is pitch-perfect for the game's emotional character.
